# Phalanx SMP

First off, in case you are confused, this repository is the MCreator one. The other repository just called `phalanx` was my attempt at manual modding. As you may notice, that one is dead and this one is alive. MCreator was just too useful.

## How can I use it?

You probably shouldn't. At present this mod is very closely targeted for Phalanx SMP, which is a private SMP of mine. If you want to use it anyway, though, you can find it on Modrinth under the same name.

## What does it do?

Right now, it just adds a claim block that alerts others when the landowner is offline (and doesn't do anything else). This feature is intended for eventual removal as the Phalanx SMP's war rules develop.

## What will it do?

Eventually, I intend for this mod to be a replacement to Villager Recruits for Phalanx. First, it should be a suitable complement to it. Both goals are not yet reached, as the published version of the mod does not add armies at all.
